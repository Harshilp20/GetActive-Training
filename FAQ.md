<h1>Common Get Active FAQ</h1>

<h2>I forgot my login credentials, who should I contact to access them?</h2>
Hi, please contact our Support Desk, they will gladly assist you with resetting and verifying your login credentials. Thank You!

<h2>I was wondering if you can add a feature to comment on a reply?</h2>
Hi, we will contact our Development Team and put in a request to add this new functionality. Once our development team have reviewed over the process of adding this feature, they will decide if it is a reasonable feature to add, if so, they will add it to their schedule.

<h2>I created an account using my Gmail, however, I do not know the password of that Gmail and it is asking me to verify my email. Is there a way to skip this?</h2>
Hi, all new users must verify their email. Since you have created an account using your Google Account, we recommend contacting Google Help to gain access to your Gmail so that you are able to verify your account. Contact Google Help using (650) 253-0000 or email them at support-in@google.com.

<h2>Whenever I try to add one of my workouts to my post, I am only able to see my most recent workout and none of the other ones I have saved, is this how the app is or is this a bug?</h2>
Hi, we believe this is a bug because a user should be able to see all of their saved workouts and they should pick one to add to their post. We have notified our Development Team and they are currently working on a solution. Thank you for your patience!  

<h2>I believe my information is being leaked and I don’t want other companies or people to access it, who should I talk to about my concern?</h2>
Please address you concerns to the Get Active Security Support Team and they will assist you further.
